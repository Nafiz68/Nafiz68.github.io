# Image Setup Instructions

## To add your profile photo:

1. **Save your profile image**:

   - Right-click on your profile photo (the one you shared)
   - Save it as `profile-photo.jpg` in the folder: `c:\Users\USER\my-portfolio\public\images\`

2. **Alternative image formats**:
   If you prefer a different format, you can also use:

   - `profile-photo.png`
   - `profile-photo.webp`

   Just make sure to update the src in Hero.js to match your file name.

3. **Image optimization tips**:
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger (will be displayed at 200x200)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File size: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

## Your image will appear in:

- The Hero section with a beautiful animated border ring
- Circular crop with hover effects
- Responsive design that scales on mobile

The image is already set up in the code - just save your photo to the specified location!
